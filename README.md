# Deep reinforcement learning for _de novo_ synthesis of eye drops
When developing eye drops, it is necessary to take into account not only the biological activity of the drug, but also a number of additional properties that affect the effectiveness of the drug. In this work, we present a novel pipeline based on reinforcement learning for the de novo synthesis of ophthalmic drugs with desired properties. We have shown that molecules generated by our method have higher values ​​of corneal permeability, melanin binding, and low toxicity compared to molecules generated by the model FREED++.

## Setup Python environment
```
# Install python environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
# Activate environment
conda activate freedpp
```
We used KAN model for melanin binding prediction. You can install pykan environment from [here](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan)
